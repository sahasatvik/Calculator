#Calculator
This is a java application which parses mathematical expressions and evaluates the result.
It supports the use of standard arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, ^), 
some functions (sin[], cos[], tan[], fct[]), setting variables, and much more!

##Sample Runtime
```
	?> 1 + 1
	=> 2.0
	?> 2 ^ (4 - 1)
	=> 8.0
	?> 2e3
	=> 2000.0
	?> x = 3!
	=> x = 6.0
	?> x^2 - x - 1
	=> 29.0
	?> y = 30
	=> y = 30.0
	?> sin[y]^2 + cos[y]^2
	=> 1.0
	?> exit
```
